# Code-Quiz

## Description
Created a Code Quiz that allows users to quiz themselves on their HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge.
Once the user clicks the Begin Quiz, a countdown timer starts. 
If a user answers a question right, they move on to the next question without penalty. 
If a user answers a question wrong, they still move on to the next question, but then they lose available time left to finish the quiz. 
Upon completion, users can then submit their initials, to save their hiscores on their local computer.
